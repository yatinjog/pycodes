#A Courier running firm want to automate the job of “service coverage area”
#based on the pin code of the AREA and it should display the message as mentioned below
#If service is available then display the statement: Service available for the locality: Area Name
#Otherwise display the statement: No Service available for the locality: Pincode
#Develop a Python program for the implementation of the above scenario?
