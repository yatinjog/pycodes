#McDonaldâ€™s sells Chicken McNuggets in packages of 6, 9 or 20 McNuggets.
#Thus, it is possible, for example, to buy exactly 15 McNuggets
#(with one package of 6 and a second package of 9),
#but it is not possible to buy exactly 16 McNuggets,
#since no non- negative integer combination of 6's, 9's and 20's add up to 16.
#To determine if it is possible to buy exactly n McNuggets,
#one has to find non-negative integer values of a, b, and c such that
#6a+9b+20c=n
